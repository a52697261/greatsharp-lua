# Getting started

Lua scripts let you extend the cheat in various ways and are a great way to automate parts of the cheat or just add that one useless feature you always wanted to have. All you need to get started is a text editor and a basic knowledge of the [Lua language](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/). If you made a lua script and would like to release it for other people to use, you can do that in the  Lua scripts subforum.

Lua scripts are stored in your Cheat Folder/Lua/Custom and loaded using the Lua container in the lua tab. If you're having trouble installing a script, refer to [Using lua ](https://capsizes.gitbook.io/greatsharp-lua/using-this-cheat/using-lua-scripts)[scripts](https://capsizes.gitbook.io/greatsharp-lua/using-this-cheat/using-lua-scripts)
